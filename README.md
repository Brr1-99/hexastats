# Hexastats

[![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/made-with-typescript.svg)](https://forthebadge.com)

A NextJS webapp which load HTML content from another website (op.gg) and filters it with string management functions to select certain data. Then, the data is loaded into a custom Context object and managed to create custom stats, graphs and ranks between our group of friends stats in a online game.

Bootstraped with tailwindcs. Data loaded without CORS using `getInitialProps` NextJS's function.
