# Hexastats

[![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/made-with-typescript.svg)](https://forthebadge.com)

A NextJS webapp which reads HTML content from another website (op.gg) without CORS using `getInitialProps` NextJS's function, filters it with strings to select certain data (not cheerio or web scrapping). Then, the data is loaded into a custom Context object and managed to create and show stats, graphs and ranks between our group of friends in a online game.

Bootstraped with tailwindcs.
