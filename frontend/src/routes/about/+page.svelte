                Hi! We are a small group of friends who wanted a way to easily compare ourselves instead of just checking out our respective opgg pages.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-5">After some research, we coded a simple script to get some basic info about our overall stats of our League of Legeds users.</p>
            <p class="mb-5">
                Eventually, because most people thought it could be a cool tool and wanted to try their usernames in the script, I decided to transform the idea
                into a web app with search system, so anyone could add themselves and their friends to make comparisons and have fun.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-5">Right now we keep working on it to improve it, adding new cool sections and new ways to interact with the data.</p>

    <p class="mt-16 mb-5 text-xl">The main plans are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>ðŸ•‘ Improve the time it takes to load the data from a player, by more than 90%</li>
        <li>ðŸŽ® Load automatically all players in a game when you enter in a new match</li>
